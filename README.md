### Interests & Career Direction

My goal is to leverage my problem-solving skills in a role that combines development with security. I am particularly interested in:

* **Application Security (AppSec):** Finding and fixing vulnerabilities within the software development lifecycle.
* **Secure Backend Development:** Building resilient server-side logic and infrastructure.
* **Systems Programming:** Working on low-level projects where performance and security are critical.

I am always open to discussing opportunities in these areas or collaborating on projects that align with my skills. Please feel free to reach out.
